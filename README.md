## Styleshets and customization

The eligibility display currently supports the following stylesheets:

- Game Room  
  ![Styling on Game Room](/screenshots/game_room.png?raw=true "Styling on Game Room")
- Other (including external)  
  ![Default styling on Elephantish](/screenshots/default(elephantish).jpg?raw=true "Default styling on Elephantish")

If you use another stylesheet and want to see specific support

### Adding support for a new stylesheet

It's fairly simple to add styling for an unsupported GGn stylesheet. In the styles folder, copy game-room.scss and game-room.ts, then modify to fit your style.
